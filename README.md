# Go Simple API

The goal of this API is to start learning Golang

## Tests

Tests can be ran with the command:

```
$ go test ./...
```

If you want the tests to run verbosely just add the `-v` flag to the command

Sequence diagrams will be generated automatically inside the `.sequence` folders and to see it you just need to open these files on any web browser.
